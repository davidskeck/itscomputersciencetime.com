This post is mostly a test of the website, but I thought I would also list some of the people I've been listening to recently:

Bret Victor- Just about everything this guy does is interesting. Look for "Stop Drawing Dead Fish", "The Humane Representation of Thought", "Media for Thinking the Unthinkable", and "Seeing Spaces"

Jonathan Blow- The maker of Braid and The Witness, Jonathan Blow talks about a more mature form of video game design. He talks about meaningful work, respecting your players, and creating interesting games. Examples are "How to Design Deep Games", "Video Games and the Human Condition", "A Programming Language for Games"

Darren Gray- I've also very much enjoyed Roguelike Radio, especially Darren Gray's very considered view of the rougelike genre.
