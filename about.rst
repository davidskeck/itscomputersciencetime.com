 This is the personal blog of Noah Ryan. I am a flight software engineer at the Langely Research Center.

 My interests include Programming Language Theory, Haskell, embedded systems programming, hobbiest electronics, and Genetic Algorithms.

 This blog is generated by Hakyll, hosted by linode, and stored on github. This is much cooler
 then my previous blog of the same name: [itscomputersciencetime](http://itscstime.blogspot.com/)
