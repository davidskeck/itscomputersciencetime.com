 This is the personal blog of Noah Ryan, a Software Engineer at the Langely Research Center.

 This blog is generated by Hakyll, hosted by linode, and stored on github. This is much cooler
 then my previous blog of the same name: [itscomputersciencetime](http://itscstime.blogspot.com/) 

 My interests include Programming Language Theory, Haskell, embedded systems programming, hobbiest electronics, and Genetic Algorithms.
